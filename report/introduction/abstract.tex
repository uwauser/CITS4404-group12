\textit{In this report, we present a comprehensive analysis of three nature inspired algorithms: The Particle Swarm Optimisation, The XXX Algorithm and the YYY Algorithm. 
We will discuss the theoretical background of these algorithms, their implementation as BitCoin trading bot,  and the results obtained from applying them to a
trading strategy optimisation problem. We discuss the theoretical background of each algorithm, and examine their performance over a range of parameters. By comparing 
contrasting performance, we investigate the perfomance of all three algorithms.}
