Nature inspired algorithms have shown to be very effective in solving complex optimization problems. A field in which these algorithms have seen new possibilites
is financial trading. The ability to develop machines and models to automate the production of profit is an incredibly appealing field of research, whether it's 
stocks, options or any financial asset. An emerging financial domain that has seen a meteoric rise in the last few decades is cryptocurrencies, creating a new market 
which is a perfect field for evaluating trading algorithm performances. Specifically, with the rise of cryptocurrencies such as BitCoin and Ethereum, 
the possibility of automating their trading has become a reality. Within this report, we will examine three algorithms:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Particle Swarm Algorithm, a relatively old optimisation algorithm that coined term \textit{swarm intelligence}
    \item XXX Algorithm
    \item YYY Algorithm
\end{enumerate}
