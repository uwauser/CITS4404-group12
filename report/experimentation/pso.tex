The particle swarm algorithm was an algorithm proposed by Kennedy et al. \cite{pso} was the original swarm intelligence algorithm. By creating a
population of particles which store local and global optimum's, it can converge on effective solutions consistently. In this experiment, we will be 
exploring the effects of population sizes and max iterations on the aforementioned parameter space in order to produce an effective cryptocurrency trading bot.
